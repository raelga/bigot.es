Bigotes WordPress Theme

== Description ==

Bigotes WordPress theme is the theme used for the bigot.es website, based on the Free Envo Magazine. After several modifications with the using the Child template mechanism provided by Wordpress, we reached some limitations that required updating the Parent theme. That's why we decided to modify the main theme, to have full control. The modified version of Envo Magazine named Bigotes, is license as the original theme  under the GNU general public license (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).
